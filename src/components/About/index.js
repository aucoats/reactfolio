                    Hello! My name is Austin. I am currently working as an industrial hemp retail specialist,
                    but I have put this portfolio together to showcase my web development prowess for your viewing 
                    pleasure and professional consideration. Consider utilizing the links in the Projects page to view
                    some of my works in greater detail. Otherwise, enjoy the portfolio page! This page was built using React.
